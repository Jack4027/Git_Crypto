Git_Crypto

This is the code for a Display and prediction application using live cryptocurrency data sets via data URLS

The app reads the data set using pandas then displays it on Flask app which also has a Dash dashboard in built.

Statistical data is shown for different datasets on the Flask homepage.

Found via the "/dashanalytics/" extension on the home page, the Dash dashboard contains interactive plotly datacharts and the full underlying dataset. 

*** I have omitted the Data set URLs as well as the flask env and other non code files.
